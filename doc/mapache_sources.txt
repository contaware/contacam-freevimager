apachelounge.com and php.net
----------------------------
 
- apache 2.4.66 VS17 x86 with OpenSSL 3.6.0
  https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
  Note: in ContaCam the mapache.exe file is the renamed httpd.exe file 
        from the apache distribution (that's so for historical reasons).

- PHP 8.2.29 VS16 x86 with OpenSSL 3.0.15
  https://windows.php.net/download/
  Note: we must download the thread safe PHP version.
  Attention: PHP 8.3 drops support for Windows 7
             (PHP 8.2 will be supported until 31 Dec 2026)
  https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration83.windows-support.php

- Visual C++ Redistributable working for Visual Studio 2015-2022
  https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/VC_redist.x86.exe
  https://www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?p=38205
  https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist
  ATTENTION: do not use the redistributables for 2026, they do not 
  support Windows 7: https://aka.ms/vs/18/release/VC_redist.x86.exe
  
Note: libcrypto-3.dll and libssl-3.dll from the thread safe and from the
      non thread safe php builds are identical, so it's ok to take the 
      newer ones between the apache and the php builds.


TS vs. NTS
----------

TS refers to multithread capable builds. NTS refers to single thread 
only builds. Use case for TS binaries involves interaction with a 
multithreaded SAPI and PHP loaded as a module into a web server. For NTS 
binaries the widespread use case is interaction with a web server 
through the FastCGI protocol, utilizing no multithreading (but also for 
example CLI)

Compile your own (not necessary right now)
------------------------------------------

*** APACHE ***

In case apachelounge.com drops x86 support, there is a how to build your own:

*** PHP *** (OLD guide which uses Visual Studio 2012)

Prepare

1. Install Visual Studio 2012

2. Download the latest PHP SDK binary tools php-sdk-binary-tools-20110915.zip from
http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/
extract all to C:\php-sdk, it should now contain three sub-directories:
bin, script and share

3. Run the "VS2012 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" and cd c:\php-sdk then run
bin\phpsdk_buildtree.bat phpdev

4. Now copy C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc9 to C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11

5. Extract PHP source to C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\php-5.6.x-src

6. Get lib and include from the used httpd-2.4.x-win32-VC11.zip and put them to
C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\deps\lib\apache2_4 and C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\deps\include\apache2_4

7. Extract the wanted dependencies from http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/ to
C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\deps
Used:
- zlib-1.2.7.3-vc11-x86.zip
- openssl-1.0.2q-vc11-x86.zip
- libiconv-1.14-vc11-x86.zip


Compile

1. cd c:\php-sdk\ and run
bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat

2. cd C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\php-5.6.x-src and run
buildconf

3. configure --help

4. configure --disable-all --enable-apache2-4handler --enable-calendar --enable-ctype --enable-filter --enable-hash --with-iconv --enable-mbstring --with-openssl --enable-session --enable-tokenizer --enable-zlib

5. nmake


Recompile

1. cd c:\php-sdk\ and run
bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat

2. cd C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\php-5.6.x-src and run
nmake clean

3. buildconf --force

4. configure (see above)

5. nmake
