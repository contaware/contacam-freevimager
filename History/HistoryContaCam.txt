  get written into that file when a crash/hang happens

9.9.10 (August 2nd 2020)

- Because the video resolution of some cams changed for a few seconds
  and afterwards restored, we decided to never reset the sensitivity

  if you change the video resolution or the zones size)

  memory shortage and system overload

- All detection frames are buffered to memory (or page file)
- Full stretch the videos in web interface
- Corrected FTP to first upload the full video/jpeg version and then

  the thumbs point through a link to the full versions
- Emailing files as plain attachments and not embedded in html as
  before because some email clients are not displaying embedded

- If no attachment is selected the motion detection email is sent really
  fast (before it was only sent when the detection storing was done)
- Configurable minimum time between motion detection email messages
- Removed the possibility to email jpeg snapshots on motion detection as
  it rarely catches what's moving. The Small Video (animated gif) is by
  far better suited as it really shows the movement (if its size is too
  small then adjust that under Save Small Video - Thumbnail Size)

- Goodbye Html Frames: web interface improved for mobile devices

  having the same name
- Installer adds now the Start Menu entry only for the Current User

- To avoid troubles in service mode from now on it's not possible
  to associate files to ContaCam (please use FreeVimager for that)
- Because of web server miss-configuration danger the possibility to
  move the individual camera folders in Camera Basic Settings dialog
  has been removed (advanced users can create junctions, symlinks or
  run a .bat script on detection to move/copy the video files to
  another location)

  and live preview so that detections can be watched better.
  Hint: in your preferred browser press F11 to enter full-screen
- Support NV12 and NV21 web camera formats
- Renamed: Device Assistant -> Camera Basic Settings
           Device Settings  -> Camera Advanced Settings
- Simplified video encoding settings by removing the bitrate
  parameter and dropped vorbis, flac and mp2 audio encoding support
- In installation folder there is a new MasterConfig.ini file

- Possibility to store temp files under the cameras root folder
- Command is now executed when detection is confirmed by filter
  and not on first movement frame 
- First version especially optimized for Windows XP SP2 and higher

  is now always on
- Removed UDP networking because it was ContaCam's proprietary
  streaming protocol not compatible with any current standard
  (it's still possible to stream a video source through the web
  server, a FAQ entry has been added illustrating that)
- Removed manual record pause command which was of no use

  recs, detections and snapshots with the same timestamp
  (only one of them was shown)
- Introduced variables like %avi%, %gif%, %swf%, ...
  passed as parameters in command execution on detection end
- UDP networking lowered default fragment size from 1400 bytes

- Moved the De-Interlace and the Rotate 180° commands from
  the Capture menu to Device Settings - General Tab

  it could end up deleting important detections when a false
  detection occurred together with a true detection and this

  and post recording

  authentication dialog for network devices

2.0.7 (August 12th 2010)

- Improved motion detection: less sensible to luminosity changes
- New gif thumbnail message in case of system overload and
  resulting drop of frames -> lower resolution and/or framerate
  if seeing such a message in the browser while looking at the
  detections!

  many things while 24h recording
- Assistant behaves now as expected with the No change selection
- Networking fix to make it work with Wine
- Fixed motion detection and recording for the RGB16(565) format
- Fixed a tedious bug of a missing emms instruction after
  the mmx deinterlacing function call. It only happened if no
  codec was initialized
