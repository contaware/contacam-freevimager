  fast (before it was only sent when the detection storing was done)
- Configurable minimum time between motion detection email messages
- Removed the possibility to email jpeg snapshots on motion detection as
  it rarely catches what's moving. The Small Video (animated gif) is by
  far better suited as it really shows the movement (if its size is too

  to associate files to ContaCam (please use FreeVimager for that)
- Because of web server miss-configuration danger the possibility to
  move the individual camera folders in Camera Basic Settings dialog
  has been removed (advanced users can create junctions, symlinks or

  and live preview so that detections can be watched better.
  Hint: in your preferred browser press F11 to enter full-screen
- Support NV12 and NV21 web camera formats
- Renamed: Device Assistant -> Camera Basic Settings
           Device Settings  -> Camera Advanced Settings
- Simplified video encoding settings by removing the bitrate
  parameter and dropped vorbis, flac and mp2 audio encoding support

  is now always on
- Removed UDP networking because it was ContaCam's proprietary
  streaming protocol not compatible with any current standard
  (it's still possible to stream a video source through the web

- Within a day the detection movies are now tagged by a number:
  1 .. detection movies count
- Live De-Interlacing works now for all capture formats,
  no need for rec/det time De-Interlacing
- Fixed a bug in the web interface which prevented showing
  recs, detections and snapshots with the same timestamp
  (only one of them was shown)
- Introduced variables like %avi%, %gif%, %swf%, ...
  passed as parameters in command execution on detection end
- UDP networking lowered default fragment size from 1400 bytes
  to 512 bytes so that it works well for all network types

3.9.9 (May 1st 2012)

- Possibility to rotate the video source by 180°
- Moved the De-Interlace and the Rotate 180° commands from
  the Capture menu to Device Settings - General Tab
- The Device Assistant dialog was not storing the changes to the
  registry (or INI file) when pressing OK. These settings were
  not lost because ContaCam saves everything to the registry
  (or INI file) when closing

3.9.7 (March 27th 2012)

- Added support for MJPG and M420 capture device formats
- Moved Movement Detection mode selection box to bottom toolbar

  dialog box

  of Animated GIF, AVI and JPG attachments

  the engine stopped saving with the last detection frame)
- Added client poll mode for Edimax IP cams
- Added support for TP-Link IP cams
- Motion detection command execution start can be configured:
  on first movement frame or after detection save,email,ftp
- Motion detector can now be set to: Off, Trigger File,
  Software or both
- Added a Delete Camera Folder(s) command in Tools menu
- USB and DV cams are now auto-reconnected when replugged
  (for network devices this is already the case)

  especially the motion detection engine is now less
  CPU intensive

- Motion detection command execution starts now on detection
  begin and not on detection end as before

- 10% HD size limit check is now each 10-15 min and the
  deletion of old files is more balanced between cameras
- Updated tutorials to reflect this version 3.9.0
- Removed false detection with blue and none blue zones because 
  it could end up deleting important detections when a false
  detection occurred together with a true detection and this
  even more if it was not well configured!
- Removed old VfW support, removed unused rec size segmentation
  and post recording

3.7.0 (November 8th 2011)
