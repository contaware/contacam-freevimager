CONTACAM HISTORY

5.5.5 (Month xxth 2017)

- Native RTSP cameras support (dropped VLC re-streaming of RTSP
  cameras)

5.5.0 (February 18th 2017)

- If a DirectShow device path is not defined use the device name
  as device path (thanks to Shaun Daigle for reporting the problem)
- Support nonce reuse (-> faster polling for digest protected cams)
- poll.php and push.php if called directly use http basic auth
- Updated lftp.exe to version 4.6.6
- Fixed memory leak of CRT threads under Windows XP

5.3.0 (November 18th 2016)

- Password protect all cameras with form based authentication
  (this authentication type works well on all browsers)
- Attach a snapshot to the daily email notification
- Using the AVIR image resizing algorithm designed by Aleksey Vaneev

5.1.0 (September 20th 2016)

- Made the application High DPI Aware (displays well on 4K monitors)
- Generates smaller mp4 files with the same quality
- Added the possibility to send a daily email notification to make
  sure the device works properly
- Increased the mailer timeout from 5 to 15 seconds (thanks to Joe
  Hannigan for reporting a problem with some slow smtp servers)
- Fixed email sending on Windows XP (thanks David Greig)
- Encrypted settings (like passwords) are now exportable and work
  well if used on another computer or by another logon user
- Compiling with Visual Studio 2015 (ContaCam runs on
  Windows XP SP3 / Windows Server 2003 SP2 or higher)

5.0.9 (June 25th 2016)

- All detection frames are buffered to memory (or page file)
- Full stretch the videos in web interface
- Corrected FTP to first upload the full video/jpeg version and then
  the corresponding thumb. That's necessary because in web interface
  the thumbs point through a link to the full versions
- Emailing files as plain attachments and not embedded in html as
  before because some email clients are not displaying embedded
  images properly
- Do not fail when no DV media present

5.0.7 (May 9th 2016)

- Email alert when device unplugged or not reachable
- Faster and more reliable FTP upload support
- Web interface video play rate buttons: 0.25x and 1.0x
- Web interface has now an optional trash / delete button
- Bigger toolbar buttons
- Added support for some Samsung cameras
- Email settings auto-fill for most common smtp servers
- Re-added the option to email a jpeg snapshot on motion detection
  (with respect to previous implementation it is sent really fast)
- Removed the standby and hibernate disabling feature introduced with
  version 5.0.1 because it also blocked entering these states manually

5.0.5 (January 8th 2016)

- Added Dahua and Hikvision support
- Made the web interface more mobile friendly
- Malformed jpeg frames reaching ContaCam are now not stopping it from
  running (thanks to Mark P for reporting the problem and helping find
  the bug)
- Added crash dump support and verbose diagnostic logging
- If no attachment is selected the motion detection email is sent really
  fast (before it was only sent when the detection storing was done)
- Configurable minimum time between motion detection email messages
- Removed the possibility to email jpeg snapshots on motion detection as
  it rarely catches what's moving. The Small Video (animated gif) is by
  far better suited as it really shows the movement (if its size is too
  small then adjust that under Save Small Video - Thumbnail Size)

5.0.3 (November 18th 2015)

- Hard-disk info display
- Show/hide commands for Statusbar and Toolbars

- Goodbye Flash Video: .swf files have been replaced by .mp4 files
  which all modern browsers and smartphones can play
- Goodbye Html Frames: web interface improved for mobile devices
- Detection frames are now buffered also to HD and not only in RAM
  (this avoids splitting a detection sequence into many files)
- Configurable minimum disk free space (works now also for network
  shares and symlinks)
- In audio input dialog the correct entry is selected for devices
  having the same name
- Installer adds now the Start Menu entry only for the Current User
- Removed Fullscreen Browser as it cannot display HTML5 videos
- To avoid troubles in service mode from now on it's not possible
  to associate files to ContaCam (please use FreeVimager for that)
- Because of web server miss-configuration danger the possibility to
  move the individual camera folders in Camera Basic Settings dialog
  has been removed (advanced users can create junctions, symlinks or
  run a .bat script on detection to move/copy the video files to
  another location)

4.9.9 (November 3rd 2014)

  recording to a cloud storage service with limited space)
- Faster avi video recording
- Web interface has gotten a button to hide date navigation
  and live preview so that detections can be watched better.
  Hint: in your preferred browser press F11 to enter full-screen
- Support NV12 and NV21 web camera formats
- Renamed: Device Assistant -> Camera Basic Settings
           Device Settings  -> Camera Advanced Settings
- Simplified video encoding settings by removing the bitrate
  parameter and dropped vorbis, flac and mp2 audio encoding support
- In installation folder there is a new MasterConfig.ini file
  which determines the configuration files location, the temporary
  folder location and whether to use the registry or an ini file
  
4.9.5 (March 24th 2014)

- Support Foscam, Tenvis and Clones mjpeg cameras in network dialog

  devices. Useful for wireless networks which tend to congest
  if all IP cams start at the same time (thanks to Sanford Gossman
  for the idea and for testing it)

  frames (thanks to Mitko for sending me the Neo NC-78 webcam)
- Possibility to store temp files under the cameras root folder
- Command is now executed when detection is confirmed by filter
  and not on first movement frame 
- First version especially optimized for Windows XP SP2 and higher
- Dropped support for theora encoding because many modern
  players are not able to play avi files encoded in such a way

  request count reached 0 and a reconnection was necessary
- Longer detection files option introduced in version 4.0.5
  is now always on
- Removed UDP networking because it was ContaCam's proprietary
  streaming protocol not compatible with any current standard
  (it's still possible to stream a video source through the web
  server, a FAQ entry has been added illustrating that)
- Removed manual record pause command which was of no use

4.1.0 (December 4th 2012)

- Live De-Interlacing works now for all capture formats,
  no need for rec/det time De-Interlacing
- Fixed a bug in the web interface which prevented showing
  recs, detections and snapshots with the same timestamp
  (only one of them was shown)
- Introduced variables like %avi%, %gif%, %swf%, ...
  passed as parameters in command execution on detection end
- UDP networking lowered default fragment size from 1400 bytes
  to 512 bytes so that it works well for all network types

  deletion of old files is more balanced between cameras
- Updated tutorials to reflect this version 3.9.0
- Removed false detection with blue and none blue zones because 
  it could end up deleting important detections when a false
  detection occurred together with a true detection and this
  even more if it was not well configured!
